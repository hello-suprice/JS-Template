4. There is an EventListener at the bottom of the JavaScript file, which keeps track of mouse clicks in the info box on the left. When you click in this box, a function is called that randomly displays a car (d) with associated captions. Add another car of your choice (picture and brand), and make sure it is included in the random selection.

5. There is a row of buttons at the bottom. A variable, `btn1`, is linked to the first button and there are examples of how the text is put on it in the JavaScript file. Complete the program by declaring variables for the other buttons and place the text in the same way as for the first button.

6. Attach an EventListener to each button. When pressed, it will call a function that prints information about the selected car. The information should be printed in the left box, and replace the existing text there. You get to choose which information, correct or fictitious, to print!

7. Expand the program so that it is also possible to press in the right window (the one with the car). When pressed there, there must be information about how many times each car has been accidentally found while driving. This count should therefore not have to do with the buttons, but only count what is randomly pressed when pressed in the left pane.
